Hi everyone 

This project is a rappresentation how to works Two Factor Authentication, of course it isn't integrate with a real application or system. 

It works with google authenticator and Postman, generate a "token" and an "ID" in the path localhost:5000/api/register, 

In the path localhost:5000/api/verify - verify if the token is correct 

In the path localhost:5000/api/validate - validate the token 

Thanks for watching code
